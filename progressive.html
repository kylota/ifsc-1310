        <h2>Progressive Writing Assignment</h2>
        <p>The main difference between the original mindset of design - graceful degradation - and progressive enhancement is foresight. <br>
        When sites were first being designed, everything was new and we were not sure if it would even last as a commonly used tool, let alone get as big as it did. Therefore, no one really knew how to prepare for the future. As web design begin picking up speed and it became clear that it was here to stay, designers began to realize that no matter how awesome a language may seem at this time, there would always be another that came after it. With that in mind, developers began to purposefully develop their codes and layouts in a way that allowed for easy updates and colloboration with other programming languages. <br><br>With graceful degradation, developers attempted to write extra code and do things to keep the older version of internet browsers relevant for as long as possible. They did this, so that people would be able to use the content for as long as possible. However, they always did it with the thought in mind that eventually the old item would be phased out, and on to the next. With progressive enhancement, we are no longer looking to throw away our old pieces, so to speak. Instead, we look for ways to use and incorpoate them as long as possible. However, one eye is always kept towards the idea that they may go down - and now sites are being developed with redundancies to ensure that if something is phased out, it can be updated fairly easily. Developers do their best to ensure the moving pieces of a site are separate from one another, whereas in the past they used to rely on each other. By being separtate, we can focus more on the content and worry less about the browser war these big companies are getting into. Despite whoever is the browser "flavor of the day", the aim is now to make sure that content is able to be anjoyed regardless.<br><br>As someone who began to learn programming in the early 90s, this has been a major relief to watch the mindset evolve. There are many sources that can be found via Goolgle which also explain this same concept. My favorite, which I hope will count although it is not technically an article, is <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2550431/what-is-the-difference-between-progressive-enhancement-and-graceful-degradation>this post on stackoverflow</a>. It brings up a point most of us can reate to: O.G. Nintendo sites. All of the best ones we loved from back in the day either no longer work, or work terribly...some are being transferred over (upgraded, if you please), but some simply do not have the resources. With progressive enhancement, we will no longer have as big a concern with this.</p>
        <p>As a last thought, I leave you with the official <a href="https://peanutbutterjellytime.net/">Peanut Butter Jelly Time</a> website. I was not even able to find an original source file in the wild, due to how poorly it aged over the years.</p>
